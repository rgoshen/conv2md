# ADR-XXX: [ADR Title]

- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

- **Status**: Proposed

## Context

Summarize the problem, constraints, stakeholders, and the domain assumptions. Link to the initial requirements/user stories and any external constraints (e.g., compliance, hosting, data residency).

## Decision

Select the initial architecture pattern (e.g., layered, hexagonal/ports-and-adapters, serverless, modular monolith) and justify why it best satisfies the current requirements while honoring the repo priorities (Security → Accessibility → Readability → Maintainability → Modularity → Optimization).

## Rationale

Explain trade-offs and why alternatives were not chosen (e.g., microservices deferred to avoid operational overhead; specific framework chosen for ecosystem/security support). Reference DRY/SOLID and task-driven TDD implications on structure.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: <e.g., clear boundaries, easier testing, simpler deploys>

- **Negative**: <e.g., initial limitations, migration paths>

- **Follow-ups**: List next ADRs you expect (datastore choice, auth strategy, messaging, observability).

## Alternatives Considered

- Alternative A — pros/cons

- Alternative B — pros/cons
