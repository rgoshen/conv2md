# Development Summary - 2025-08-16

## What Was Done

### Requirements Gathering & Analysis ✅
- Analyzed existing project documentation (README.md, CONV2MD_FEATURES.md, pyproject.toml)
- Created comprehensive requirements document at `docs/requirements/requirements.md`
- Documented functional (F001-F008), non-functional (NF001-NF005), security (S001-S003), and architecture requirements
- Defined user stories, success metrics, and risk assessment

### Task Planning & Breakdown ✅  
- Created structured task list in root `todo.md` following CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL.md guidelines
- Organized tasks into 3 milestones: MVP Core (P0), Enhanced Features (P1), Plugin System (P2)
- Applied task decomposition strategy: Core Behavior → Error Handling → Integration Points → Security → Observability → Testing → Documentation
- Estimated tasks using T-shirt sizing (S/M/L) and identified dependencies

### Project Structure Setup ✅
- Implemented proper directory structure per CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL.md requirements
- Created clean architecture directories: `domain/`, `application/`, `adapters/`, `ports/`
- Set up test structure: `unit/`, `integration/`, `contract/`
- Copied and organized project templates (CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, PR/Issue templates)
- Created documentation directories: `decisions/`, `security/`, `architecture/`
- Established `summary/` directory for daily development tracking

### Initial Architecture Design ✅
- Created ADR-001 documenting hexagonal architecture decision
- Designed core architecture following Ports & Adapters pattern with Clean Architecture layering
- Created architecture overview documentation with layer responsibilities and data flow
- Generated Mermaid diagrams for system context, containers, and components
- Established security boundaries and plugin isolation strategy

## Why These Decisions Were Made

### Hexagonal Architecture Choice
- **Stdlib isolation**: Core domain logic can remain pure Python stdlib while adapters handle external dependencies
- **Plugin support**: Alternative adapter implementations enable `--use-plugins` functionality without affecting core
- **Deterministic output**: External I/O isolated from conversion logic ensures reproducible results
- **Testability**: Clear boundaries enable comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Security**: Input validation concentrated at adapter boundaries

### Task Organization Strategy
- **Milestone-based planning**: Enables iterative delivery of user value
- **Dependency mapping**: Ensures proper build order and parallel work opportunities  
- **TDD integration**: Each task starts with failing test, supports red-green-refactor cycle
- **Risk mitigation**: P0 tasks focus on core functionality, reducing technical risk

## Risks Identified

### Technical Risks
1. **Stdlib limitations**: html.parser may be insufficient for complex websites
   - *Mitigation*: Plugin system provides BeautifulSoup alternative
2. **Determinism challenges**: External content changes could affect reproducibility
   - *Mitigation*: Content hashing and timestamp handling in domain layer
3. **Performance with large inputs**: Memory usage for large websites/conversations
   - *Mitigation*: Streaming processing and input size warnings planned

### Architectural Risks
1. **Over-engineering**: Hexagonal architecture may be complex for current scope
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple implementations, refactor as needed
2. **Plugin complexity**: Plugin isolation may introduce maintenance overhead
   - *Mitigation*: Core-first development, plugins as optional enhancements

## Follow-up Actions Needed

### Immediate Next Steps (Tomorrow)
1. Begin Milestone 1 implementation with Project Foundation feature
2. Create core domain entities (Conversation, Document, Image)
3. Set up initial test infrastructure with unittest framework
4. Implement basic CLI interface with click framework

### Security Actions Required
1. Create OWASP security assessment (ASVS matrix)
2. Design input validation framework  
3. Document threat models for web content processing
4. Establish secrets management strategy

### Documentation Pending
1. Complete security documentation requirements
2. Create plugin development guide template
3. Establish API documentation standards
4. User guide and examples
